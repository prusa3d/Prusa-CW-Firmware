## Building with Cmake
### Automatic, remote, using travis-ci

Create new github user, eg. your_user_name-your_repository_name-travis. This step is not mandatory, only recomended to limit access rights for travis to single repository. Grant this user access to your repository. Register this user on https://travis-ci.org/. Create API key for this user. In Github click on this user, settings, Developer settings, Personal access tokens, Generate new token, select public_repo, click on Generate token and copy this token.

Login into https://travis-ci.org/ enable build of your repository, click on repository setting, add environment variable `ACCESS_TOKEN` and paste your token.

Each commit is build, but only for tagged commits `Prusa-CW-Firmware.hex` is attached to your release by travis.

### Automatic, local, using script and prepared tools package
#### Linux

You need to install unzip and wget tools, next run the following command : 
~~~
./build.sh
~~~

It downloads neccessary tools, extracts it to `../MM-build-env-<version>`, creates `../Prusa-CW-Firmware-build folder`, configures build scripts in it and builds it using ninja.

#### Windows

Download `MM-build-env-Win64-<version>.zip` from https://github.com/prusa3d/MM-build-env/releases. Unpack it and run `configure.bat`. This opens cmake-gui with preconfigured tools paths. Select path where is your source code located, select where you wish to build - out of source build is recomended. Click on generate, select generator - Ninja, or \<Your favourite IDE\> - Ninja.
  
Then, run `build.bat` generated in your binary directory.

### Manually with installed tools

You need cmake, avr-gcc, avr-libc and cmake supported build system (e.g. ninja) installed.

Out of source tree build is recommended, in case of Eclipse CDT project file generation is necceessary. If you don't want out of source tree build, you can skip this step.
~~~
cd ..
mkdir Prusa-CW-Firmware-build
cd Prusa-CW-Firmware-build
~~~
Generate build system - consult `cmake --help` for build systems generators and IDE project files supported on your platform.
~~~
cmake -G "build system generator" path_to_source
~~~
example 1 - build system only
~~~
cmake -G "Ninja" ../Prusa-CW-Firmware
~~~
example 2 - build system and project file for your IDE
~~~
cmake -G "Eclipse CDT4 - Ninja" ../Prusa-CW-Firmware-build
~~~
Invoke build system you selected in previous step. Example:
~~~
ninja
~~~
The file `MM-control-01.hex` is generated.

## Flashing
### Windows
#### Slic3er

Configuration > Flash printer firmware, then fill up the path to generated .hex and hit Flash!

#### Avrdude

Board needs to be reset to bootloader. Bootloader has 5 seconds timeout and then returns to the application.

This can be accomplished manually by clicking reset button on MMU, or programmatically by opening and closing its virtual serial line at baudrate 1500.

Than flash it using following command, replace \<virtual serial port\> with CDC device created by MMU usually `com<nr>` under Windows and `/dev/ttyACM<nr>` under Linux. `-b` baud rate is don't care value, probably doesn't have to be specified at all, as there is no physical uart.
~~~
avrdude -v -p atmega32u4 -c avr109 -P <virtual serial port> -b 57600 -D -U flash:w:Prusa-CW-Firmware-build.hex:i
~~~

### Linux

Same as Windows, but there is known issue with `ModemManager` : you either need to deinstall it, or blacklist the Prusa Research USB devices: 
 * create or edit `/etc/udev/rules.d/99-mm.rules` in order to add : 
~~~
# Original Prusa i3 MK3 Multi Material 2.0 upgrade
ATTRS{idVendor}=="2c99", ATTRS{idProduct}=="0007", ENV{ID_MM_DEVICE_IGNORE}="1"
ATTRS{idVendor}=="2c99", ATTRS{idProduct}=="0008", ENV{ID_MM_DEVICE_IGNORE}="1"
~~~
 * Then reload udev rules : 
~~~
$ sudo udevadm control --reload-rules
~~~

A request has been sent to Ubuntu, Debian and ModemManager to blacklist the whole Prusa Research VID space.

 * https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/pkgreport.cgi?dist=unstable;package=modemmanager
 * and reported to https://lists.freedesktop.org/archives/modemmanager-devel/2018-July/006471.html

## Building documentation

Run `doxygen` in `Prusa-CW-Firmware` folder.
The documentation is generated in `Doc/` subfolder.
